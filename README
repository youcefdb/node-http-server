    Read and Write On Files:
* Thre are some method from "fs/promies" (Async) used for read and write on files, wherever, it good to creat your own path, because of changing platforms, that's why you have to use "path.join", and make sur when you want creat a directory you have to handle the allready file existing, there for you have to add, "{recursive: ture}".
* There is a "existSync()" funciton from "fs" (Sycn) used to check existing file and directorys, but it's not recommend because of race condition.

    project.json and packege:
* We Have Create An "project.json" (npm init) in our project so we can install npms and we can see theme on dependency, and know more details about our project(the code will work, but it's not recommaned)
for installing packege => npm install name (-G option)
for deleting => npm rm (-g option) name (you have to update script if any)

    Uploading File:
* If You Don't Want Include Something When You Want Push Your Project To GitHub, make a new file names "./gitignor", all the moduels and stuff on here will not be pushed, and later if someone clone your project, he will write "npm install", this command will read your "project.json", and install all your dependency and create a node_modules

    Dependency and Dev Dependency:
* for dev dependency => npm install module -D
On project.json, dependency is the stuff that wihtout theme the project will not work, and devDependency used for help devaloper
On "project.json", there is part names "script", this part used for save command, "name": "command", and run by "npm run keyName"

    Controlling version update:
* in "project.json", you can see on value of a key some values x.x.x, wherever, 
    Adding "^" means that it can update the second number and the thured, but not the first
    Adding "~" means update just the path (the thurd number)
    Adding "*" means update everthing (not recommend)
if you want install a specific version => npm i uuid@x.x.x

    Event Emitter:
* We can hear or do events wherever something happend, you can create:
    a custom one(Emitter) from "event", ev.on("key", () =>{...}), and you can hear using ev.emit("key");
    a default one, like "exit".., here you don't need to pass "exit" on "on.emit(".."), the NodeJs will do

    Creating Server:
* We have to import "http" from "http", and creating server using "http.createServer((req, res))" and accept request and respose
* Eeach time we reach the server, a callback functino excute (req, res), so it's good to see the type of request, req.url(where) and req.method (type of acessing the server)
* To let server hear to requests, we have to create a port, and start listenning => server.listen(port, () => {when start}), this function will execute just one time
